    <p> ahh my bubba, you're my cute precious pretty little babyy. So as you know, I've recently started to learn how to make these, now ik i can go to claude and ask it to make this for me, but then it would'nt be this special now would it hehehe. All afternoon when i told u i was coding, this is what i was upto hehe🥰</p>
    <p> You just brighten my day like no one else dummy and I'm so so grateful for you munchkin, for your love, your humour and most importantly, princess sofia😚, no but fr, you're my packet of sunshine bubba,you're not just a part of my world, you're my world entire🐧...when im fed up of this world, im so thankful that i have my other world to go to, and it makes all my problems go away mwahh. being w you, i have learnt how to laugh even in the toughest situations (especially in serious situations where i shouldnt)😭</p>
    <p> i just wanna hug u bubba, i just miss you too damn much. I genuinely don't remember my life before u in it and i dont want that to ever change bubba. you're it for me, ur my everything bubba</p>
    <p> its almost about to be a month since i came back to college and i miss those days so much yaar, I just miss being able to say ki oye come fast fast 30 mins mein, i miss looking out at the traffic where ur stuck and so so mad, but most of all i miss that comforting feeling that i used to get when i saw you, the whole world around us just disappeared, it was just us. I miss comforting you when you were upset, i miss just stop in the middle for a hug, i just MISS those times when u came over and we played snooker or foseball and how flustured u used to get when u saw mom and dad.</p>
    <p> i can't wait to see you again bubba, I truly never express how much my miss all that but i always watch our videos before i go to sleep, those laughs, us in timezone, the car vlog, atp i must have everything memorised hahahha. Come to meet me fast fast bubba, i just wanna hug and cuddle with you all day. I just wanna be in bed wrapped in your arms while ur kissing me everywhere ahhhh  </p>
